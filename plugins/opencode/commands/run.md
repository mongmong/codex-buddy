Delegate a write-capable task to opencode through the companion script.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command IS write-capable: opencode may modify files in your repo (especially with --yolo).
- Surface the companion's output verbatim. Do not interpret or summarize the work opencode did.

Pre-flight (safety prompts):
1. **--yolo confirmation.** If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--yolo`, use AskUserQuestion exactly once with the question: `"--yolo will pass --dangerously-skip-permissions to opencode. opencode will edit files in your repo without prompting. Confirm?"` Options: `Confirm and proceed` / `Cancel`. If the user picks Cancel, stop without invoking the companion.
2. **--background acknowledgement.** If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--background`, no prompt — the user explicitly chose detached execution. Just remind them of `/opencode:status <id>` for tracking.
3. If neither --yolo nor --background, no pre-flight prompt — opencode's own permission system gates writes.

Model selection (REQUIRED before invoking run):

Same flow as `/opencode:review`. Skip if `$ARGUMENTS` already contains `--model <value>`.

1. List models: `node plugins/opencode/scripts/buddy.mjs models`
2. AskUserQuestion with one option per model (default first, suffixed `(default)`). 4-option cap; if more, present the first 3 plus `Other (specify model id)` with a free-text follow-up validated against the captured listing.
3. Capture as `$CHOSEN_MODEL`. If empty after the picker, stop.

Execution:

```bash
node plugins/opencode/scripts/buddy.mjs run --model "$CHOSEN_MODEL" "$ARGUMENTS"
```

If the user-supplied `--model` path was taken (skipping the picker), invoke instead WITHOUT the injected `--model`:

```bash
node plugins/opencode/scripts/buddy.mjs run "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Output handling:
- Return the script's stdout verbatim.
- For foreground runs, the output ends with a `Files changed:` summary derived from `git diff --stat`. Do not add additional summarization.
- For `--background` runs, the output is a one-line `Started job <id>` plus follow-up command hints. Surface verbatim.

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly (apart from injecting the model picker's choice).
- Supported flags: `--task`, `--task-file`, `--model`, `--variant`, `--yolo`, `--background`, `--session-key`, `--reset`, `--no-session`. Unknown flags or unexpected positional args are rejected with exit 2 — surface the error verbatim.

Reasoning effort (v0.5.0+):
- Pass `--variant <level>` to select a provider-specific reasoning effort (e.g. `high`, `max`, `minimal`). The exact set is provider-defined; opencode forwards the value unchanged.
- Useful for tasks where you want a deeper or cheaper pass without switching models. Honored only by providers that expose reasoning variants.

Session continuity (v0.3.0+):
- By default, this command **resumes the prior opencode session** scoped to `(plan-or-branch, role=run, model)`. Successive runs on the same plan/branch share the prior context — useful for "continue where I left off" iterations.
- Session key is derived from the git branch: `feature/plan-NNN-*` → `plan-NNN`; other branches → `branch-<sanitised>`; non-git → `scratch`.
- `--session-key <name>` to override the rule.
- `--reset` to discard the stored session-id and start fresh (recovery for confused sessions).
- `--no-session` for a one-off detached task that does NOT touch the running thread (skips reuse + save).
