Toggle the workspace-level Stop-hook review gate.

Raw slash-command argument: `$ARGUMENTS`

Run:

```bash
node plugins/opencode/scripts/buddy.mjs gate "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Surface the script's stdout verbatim. The script accepts `on`, `off`, `status` (default), and rejects anything else with exit 2.

When `gate on` enables the gate, the runtime setting is persisted for the review gate helper. Automatic lifecycle hook installation remains disabled in `hooks.json` until Codex lifecycle event names are verified. The helper fails open on review-system errors and smart-skips read-only turns (no git changes). See `/opencode:gate status` to confirm the current state.
